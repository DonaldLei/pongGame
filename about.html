        <p>
            The objective of the game is to not let the ball go past your paddle.
            If the ball manages to go past your paddle then the game will end. To prevent the ball 
            from going past the left side you need to hit the ball with your paddle which you are in control of.
            Each time the ball is hit 1 point is earned. Additionally, hitting the ball with the ends
            of the paddle will grant additional points. Good luck highscore getters!
